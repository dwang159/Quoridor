Python Quoridor
===============

This code is currently under major redesign. The new architecture will still be python. This time it is being designed with the public-facing API in mind, potentially to be presented as a webpage.

The original (sort of broken) code is still on the master branch, and also in "old_code/". It can be run with `python TkBoard.py` for a regular game, `python TkBoard.py 4` for a 4-player game, `python TkBoard.py 2 1` for a 2-player game with 1 AI, etc...

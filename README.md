Python Quoridor
===============

## Runnin' it

Just some code. no installation or anything.

The interface is TkBoard.py, so run with:

    python TkBoard.py
    -or-
    python TKBoard.py 2

Four player:

    python TkBoard.py 4

## Interface

The board itself and what I call the "panel" on the right should both be pretty self-explanatory..

**Controls**

* press M, or click 'move' button - make current move some movement
* press W, or click 'wall' button - make current move placing a wall
* press SPACE - toggle type of move
* Arrow Keys - move in that direction
* Click on board to move to a space or place a wall
* Escape - quit

## AI

Nothing yet (currently does 2-player)

Hopefully soon I'll add a basic AI, and finish the API so other people can submit AIs to battle each other
